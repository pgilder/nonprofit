## Meteor Implementation of Pages Theme
Fully Integrated demo pages and components build for meteor v1.2.0

## Tech Spec
 * Layout uses FlowRouter and FlowLayout
  * iron:router was switched out due to recent trouble in the community / no continuation
 * Begun, where easily possible, to scope jQuery actions `$` to the template `tpl.$`
  * has the benefit to freely re-use templates without css-properties/classes (ie. widget-1320)
 * Some code clean-up and consistency in naming conventions. Semicolons for magnifications etc. mostly according to [meteor style guide](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/wiki/Meteor-Style-Guide)
